# Recommendation system for Spotify based on the 'energy' levels of the songs 
- The .csv file used for the DataFrame production is name 'data_moods.csv' and can be found in this repository
- If you have any problems visualizing the recommendation system, clone the repository in order to run it locally
- In case the 3D scatterplot for the cluster is not displayed, you can see a .png shot of it in 3d_plot.png
- Hope you enjoy my project
